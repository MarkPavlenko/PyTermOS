# Set a standard resolution to start with, which most HDMI monitors should support.
hdmi_group=1   # CEA
hdmi_mode=16   # 1080p 60Hz

# If there are still issues, consider specifying a lower resolution:
# hdmi_group=2  # DMT (more monitor-focused, less TV-focused)
# hdmi_mode=35  # 1280x1024 @ 60Hz, a common monitor resolution

# Adjust the GPU memory split depending on your needs:
gpu_mem=64  # Increase if you run graphics-heavy applications, decrease if not needed.

# Enable I2C and SPI interfaces for peripherals

# Disable the splash screen for faster boot

# If you are experiencing under-voltage warnings or power issues:
# Avoid warnings shown at the top right of the display (lightning bolt icon).
avoid_warnings=1  # Set to 2 to also avoid under-voltage warnings.

# Overclocking settings (be cautious, only use if necessary and you know the risks):
#arm_freq=1500  # Overclock the CPU on Pi 4 (default is 1500MHz, can try higher like 1750MHz)
#over_voltage=2  # Required for higher overclocks, increases processor voltage

# Adding initramfs just for fun

# Disable WiFi at boot to remove infinite boot
